        <h1>Welcome to our study.</h1>
        <p>Before we start, we would need your informed consent to participate. Please read the following throughly and carefully.</p>

            <h1>Online studies in learning, decision-making and cognition: <br>Information and consent</h1>

            <h3>Who is conducting this research study?</h3>
            <p>This research is being conducted by the Division of Psychiatry
                and the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research
                at University College London, London, UK.
                The lead researchers for this project is <a href="mailto:q.huys@ucl.ac.uk">Professor Quentin Huys</a>.
                This study has been approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee (project ID number 16639/001)
                and is funded by the Max Planck Society,
                the Masason Foundation and the UCL Institute of Mental Health.</p>

            <h3>What is the purpose of this study?</h3>
            <p>We are interested in how the adult brain controls learning and decision-making.
                This research aims to provide insights into how the healthy brain works to
                help us understand the causes of a number of different medical conditions.</p>

            <h3>Who can participate in the study?</h3>
            <p>You must be 18 or over to participate in this study.></p>

            <h3>What will happen to me if I take part?</h3>
            <p>You will play one or more online computer games,
                which will last approximately 45 minutes.
                You will receive at least 8.21 GBP per hour (about 6.16 GDP for a 45 minutes session) for helping us out
                with an opportunity for an additional bonus depending on your choices.
                The amount may vary with the decisions you make in the games.
                Remember, you are free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason.
            </p>

            <h3>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h3>
            <p>The task will you complete does not pose any known risks.</p>


            <h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
            <p>While there are no immediate benefits to taking part,
                your participation in this research will help us understand
                how people make decisions and this could have benefits for our understanding of mental health problems.
            </p>

            <h3>Complaints</h3>
            <p>If you wish to complain or have any concerns about any aspect of the way you
